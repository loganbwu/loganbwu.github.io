                To Prof. David Wilson,<br/><br/>

                I would like to apply for your Research Assistant position. I am currently about to finish an MPhil in infection disease modelling in August, and I believe my experience makes me uniquely positioned to help your team carry out its work, which seems to be at the intersection of my previous roles. I am skilled in a range of tools that should be critical for your key responsibility areas (see skills below), but more importantly, practical experience in identifying when clients and in-house teams could be getting more out of their time and assets through more efficient or innovative methods.<br/><br/>

                I am looking for a position in a team that pushes for innovation. In my previous work, I enjoyed working with my International Development clients (we specialised in mitigation of natural hazards for education systems in select Pacific Islands, with a large focus on health and safety) and my analytics team at the Department of Health (COVID-19). I have also learned valuable skills in my MPhil about health systems and the research process, and I hope to combine these experiences in your team.<br/><br/>
                Kind regards,<br/>
                Logan Wu
